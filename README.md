# Artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development

Drug discovery is a very complicated large process that needs high cost and is so time-consuming. By the integration of artificial intelligence, the efficiency and the effectiveness of these processes were significantly enhanced. This article discussed how artificial intelligence improved the drug discovery and development processes and their different applications in the pharmaceutical industry.

**Method domains of artificial intelligence:**

Artificial intelligence includes many different method domains, among them is machine learning which uses algorithms that can recognize patterns within a set of data and a subfield of machine learning is deep learning which engages artificial neural networks (ANNs) that act as "perceptons" which mimics the human biological neurons as they receive inputs and transform them into outputs and it's classified into many types of networks that developed many tools which are used to form the core of the AI system such as IBM Watson super computer that was able to detect breast cancer in 60 s.

**AI in drug discovery:**

Problems in drug discovery like time-consuming and high-cost processes can now be overcome by AI, since that AI can easily recognize the hit and lead compounds and can also accelerates the validation of target protiens and drug optimization processes and the prediction of drug-protien interaction. Also, traditional QSAR models face problems such as small training sets, experimental data error in training sets, and lack of experimental validations. The problem was solved by using deep learning which showed enhanced efficacy evaluations of drug molecules based on big data modeling and analysis.

Also, AI plays an important role in drug screening. Algorithms, such as Nearest-Neighbour classifiers, RF, extreme learning machines, SVMs, and deep neural networks (DNNs), are used for virtual screening and can also predict in vivo activity and toxicity. So, AI facilitated many processes such as the prediction of toxicity, bioactivity, physicochemical characters of drugs and the identification and classification of target cells.

**Challenges in adopting AI:**

It's is essential for AI success that the data provided should be reliable and of high quality to ensure accurate result prediction. Also, the lack of skilled personnel to operate AI-based platforms, limited budget for small organizations and job loss can be challenging for adopting AI.

In conclusion, the integration of AI in pharmaceutical industry will lead to a promising future in drug discovery and drug development which will address the unmet medical needs than ever before.
